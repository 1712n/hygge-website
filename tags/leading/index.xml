Mastering this asynchronous workflow is vital to avoiding dysfunction. This is why Hygge companies prefer GitHub issues to chats and video calls. This also means that employees need to ensure that all conclusions made during offline conversations are recorded in GitHub, so that everyone at any time can follow your thought process.</description></item><item><title>Feedback</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/feedback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/feedback/</guid><description>The importance of feedback Human beings are social by nature.

Work is always easier when you know the person you‚Äôre communicating with. That‚Äôs why Hygge Companies not only encourage personal interactions during team calls, meetups, and workations but also organize Hygge Roulette to foster interpersonal communication.
Team calls Working remotely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean working alone. To keep everyone involved, Hygge Companies have regular calls where team members share their work and lives.</description></item><item><title>Buddy guidelines</title><link>https://hygge.work/growing/buddy-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/growing/buddy-guidelines/</guid><description>Visiting another country or hiking an unknown trail all by yourself definitely has its advantages.

Try attention management instead of time management and use time-saving tools and shortcuts.
Priorities Rules, guidelines, principles, people, they all have influence on what you do and how you do it. How do you figure out who to listen to and what to prioritize? Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of things to consider in the order of their importance:</description></item><item><title>Milestones</title><link>https://hygge.work/github/milestones/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/github/milestones/</guid><description>Milestone is a SMART goal, that can be split into individual issues for steps and closed at the end of a sprint. It is not a place to collect thematically similar issues (project boards allow to organize your work in many different ways). Ideally, every milestone should be:
Specific ‚Äì Well defined, clear, and unambiguous.

This is the type of goal that you will always start &amp;ldquo;tomorrow&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;next week&amp;rdquo;, but those times never seem to come.</description></item><item><title>Project Boards</title><link>https://hygge.work/github/project-boards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/github/project-boards/</guid><description>Project boards is a managing tool to improve visibility of the work progress.

However, there is a rule of a performance survey in Hygge companies: you don&amp;rsquo;t talk about the performance survey. Besides being a stressful experience for the employee being reviewed, filling out performance surveys is often an uncomfortable process for the reviewers and the managers who evaluate the results. Performance reviews often suffer from reviewer&amp;rsquo;s bias and might also lead to employee&amp;rsquo;s focus shift towards gaming the metrics instead of getting the job done.</description></item><item><title>Guiding Principles</title><link>https://hygge.work/guiding-principles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/guiding-principles/</guid><description>Take the initiative It will be difficult to understand how everything works by sitting quietly. There are no marching orders delivered to you on a daily basis, so the only sure way to figure things out is to take the initiative and to talk to people.
