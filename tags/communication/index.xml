Mastering this asynchronous workflow is vital to avoiding dysfunction. This is why Hygge companies prefer GitHub issues to chats and video calls. This also means that employees need to ensure that all conclusions made during offline conversations are recorded in GitHub, so that everyone at any time can follow your thought process.</description></item><item><title>Feedback</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/feedback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/feedback/</guid><description>The importance of feedback Human beings are social by nature. Our inclination to change our behavior in reliance upon feedback from our fellows is a primary evolutionary adaptation mechanism. Feedback is our relationship with the world and the world’s relationship with us, it’s how we make an impact on other people.

Work is always easier when you know the person you’re communicating with. That’s why Hygge Companies not only encourage personal interactions during team calls, meetups, and workations but also organize Hygge Roulette to foster interpersonal communication.
Team calls Working remotely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean working alone. To keep everyone involved, Hygge Companies have regular calls where team members share their work and lives.</description></item><item><title>workation</title><link>https://hygge.work/blog/workation-how-to/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/blog/workation-how-to/</guid><description>One of the most efficient ways to make Hygge Companies&amp;rsquo; people feel cozy and cared, is to arrange a great workation for them. We believe that workations serve as a first-aid for fully-distributed teams to heal all sorts of communication, intercultural, and work-related issues, therefore should be included into the basic benefits package. Bringing people to a colocated environment 2-4 times a year has a major impact on combating social isolation, preventing burn-out, and fostering new ties in the team that eventually can grow into new products for your business.</description></item></channel></rss>
