Creating a natural environment that attracts and retains this talent is essential. We&amp;rsquo;ve picked Hygge (sounds like hyoo·guh), a Danish word for a mood of coziness and wellness as an embodiment of a people-centric approach to creating that fertile talent land. Organizations that strive to implement ideas, described in this workbook, are called Hygge Companies.
Hygge Workbook is a culture blueprint for distributed teams that covers various aspects of the new way of working, from creating and managing atomic work tasks to surviving the mental health marathon.</description></item><item><title>Remote Work</title><link>https://hygge.work/remote-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/remote-work/</guid><description>Don’t expect to transfer the norms of co-located corporations into a work-from-anywhere scenario. When working in a fully-remote company, people are free from commuting and colleagues’ questionable music choices. You can work from wherever you want, whenever you want. Experiment with different work environments. The more focused you are in your surroundings, the quicker you can accomplish your tasks and move on to important nonwork activities. Feel free to spend a month working on the beach sipping a Mai Thai, or whatever else makes you happy and productive.</description></item><item><title>GitHub</title><link>https://hygge.work/github/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/github/</guid><description>GitHub is often used as an issue tracker, planning tool, documentation portal, code repository, and much more. Working in GitHub can seem frustrating at first, but you will be surprised with all the features it is offering to help you optimize your day-to-day communications and tasks.</description></item><item><title>Async</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/async/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/async/</guid><description>To get things done, Hygge Companies rely on detailed documentation and atomic iterations that are visible to everyone through issue trackers like GitHub. Mastering this asynchronous workflow is vital to avoiding dysfunction. This is why Hygge companies prefer GitHub issues to chats and video calls. This also means that employees need to ensure that all conclusions made during offline conversations are recorded in GitHub, so that everyone at any time can follow your thought process.</description></item><item><title>Challenge Program</title><link>https://hygge.work/growing/challenge-program/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/growing/challenge-program/</guid><description>The challenge program is a perfect tool for discovering hidden talent by autonomously vetting potential employees and interns at the start of the hiring process. The program consists of issues that can be solved without any access to company resources and require the participants to manage their own work. Such projects give interested individuals a chance to prove themselves, learn a bit about the company and products, and produce useful results in the process.</description></item><item><title>Feedback</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/feedback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/feedback/</guid><description>The importance of feedback Human beings are social by nature. Our inclination to change our behavior in reliance upon feedback from our fellows is a primary evolutionary adaptation mechanism. Feedback is our relationship with the world and the world’s relationship with us, it’s how we make an impact on other people. Working in co-located environments, we are accustomed to making evaluations based on verbal and non-verbal signals: body language, tone of voice, facial expression, and many more.</description></item><item><title>Peer Coaching</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/peer-coaching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/peer-coaching/</guid><description>Peer coaching is a form of learning and development where two team-members work together to reflect on current practices; expand, refine, and build new skills; share ideas; teach one another; or solve problems. It&amp;rsquo;s used in some Hygge Companies to improve internal communication and foster personal development of the team-members. These conversations rely on feedback giving and receiving skills.
Peer Coaching Policy Template Every 3 months (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1) we devote some time to self-study and practice feedback during the peer coaching process.</description></item><item><title>Staying Social</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/staying-social/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/staying-social/</guid><description>Distributed teams need to work together and communicate intensively. Work is always easier when you know the person you’re communicating with. That’s why Hygge Companies not only encourage personal interactions during team calls, meetups, and workations but also organize Hygge Roulette to foster interpersonal communication.
Team calls Working remotely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean working alone. To keep everyone involved, Hygge Companies have regular calls where team members share their work and lives.</description></item><item><title>Tools</title><link>https://hygge.work/tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/tools/</guid><description>To make things simple, we use examples of specific tools below to illustrate how a distributed team can be set up. Most of these tools have free versions that can be used by distributed teams with a $0 budget.</description></item><item><title>Personal Project</title><link>https://hygge.work/growing/personal-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/growing/personal-project/</guid><description>Every newcomer&amp;rsquo;s journey at Hygge Company starts with a personal project. Personal project is a private space to set and track personal milestones. It can take different forms - personal repository or a dashboard, depends on an issue tracker that Hygge company uses.
Enjoy making daily to-do lists? Want to test how markdown on GitHub works? Planning to learn Python from a colleague? Personal project is a powerful tool that satisfies all those needs.</description></item><item><title>Communication</title><link>https://hygge.work/communication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/communication/</guid><description>Whether it’s different time zones or having a fully distributed asynchronous team, practicing clear and effective communication is crucial. To accomplish this, Hygge companies communicate through issue trackers and corporate chats. On the rare occasions when this isn’t enough, jump on a synchronous video call. To find out when we use GitHub, chats, and calls, refer to the Tools section.
If it’s not in GitHub, it never happened. Hygge Companies preserve all key conversations and discussions in the issue tracker so they have the entire history of their projects in one place.</description></item><item><title>Sisu</title><link>https://hygge.work/sisu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/sisu/</guid><description>Hygge Companies hire certain types of people: the selection process is designed to spot talented people who are passionate about what they do and ready to hustle to achieve their goals, both personal and professional.
In remote settings, Hygge employees have to learn to manage their resources and energy in a new way. This is why Hygge Companies adopt the concept of good daily sisu to keep their people going.</description></item><item><title>Buddy guidelines</title><link>https://hygge.work/growing/buddy-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/growing/buddy-guidelines/</guid><description>Visiting another country or hiking an unknown trail all by yourself definitely has its advantages. But if you want to get to know all the local tips and tricks, discover the best view-points and learn fast and safe ways up, you look for local guides.
The same is when you join a new team. A new employee’s onboarding experience is greatly enhanced by buddy who acts as a local guide.</description></item><item><title>Attention Management</title><link>https://hygge.work/remote-work/attention-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/remote-work/attention-management/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s no one to tell you how to organize your day and prioritize important things. Try attention management instead of time management and use time-saving tools and shortcuts.
Priorities Rules, guidelines, principles, people, they all have influence on what you do and how you do it. How do you figure out who to listen to and what to prioritize? Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of things to consider in the order of their importance:</description></item><item><title>Google Workspace</title><link>https://hygge.work/tools/google-workspace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/tools/google-workspace/</guid><description>Google Workspace is the professional version of Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Docs, Team Drive, and much more. It provides great functionality that covers Hygge companies&amp;rsquo; need in access management, planning and working. A corporate Google account not only grants access to that whole ecosystem but also serves as the key to other web applications. The world where you needed to create separate accounts with unique passwords for each application is fading away.</description></item><item><title>Growing</title><link>https://hygge.work/growing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/growing/</guid><description>Hiring Hygge Companies believe in career choices guided by internal curiosity and the desire to do something meaningful. As intrinsic motivation seems to be one of the keys to happy remote work, Hygge Companies focus attract talent using Challenge and Bar Raiser programs to constantly evolve by hiring only the best people.
Typically, a selection process includes:
Job posting Challenge Submission Up to three interviews Hiring decision and onboarding</description></item><item><title>Corporate chats</title><link>https://hygge.work/tools/chats/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/tools/chats/</guid><description>Hygge Companies stick to asynchronous communication. This means that out of all the communication channels, they choose those where people don’t have to be present at the same time or in the same space, either physically or virtually.
However, some team-building interactions are meant to be synchronous, such as company chats. Element and Signal are good examples of secure chats. They are great team-building tools that enable water cooler-like conversations and calls.</description></item><item><title>Personal Growth</title><link>https://hygge.work/growing/personal-growth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/growing/personal-growth/</guid><description>Hygge Companies hire people not only because they are useful now, but also because they believe in their potential.
Working in a Hygge Company provides an opportunity for extremely efficient and, in many cases, very accelerated, career growth. In particular, it provides an opportunity to broaden your skill set well outside the narrow constraints that careers can have at most other companies. There is no red tape, allowing you to tailor your own “growth ladder”.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://hygge.work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/</guid><description>Welcome to Hygge Workbook! Hygge Workbook is an open-source GitHub-based book of knowledge for distributed teams that covers various aspects of the new way of working, from creating and managing atomic work tasks to surviving the mental health marathon.

In remote teams, leaders have the opportunity to create an environment in which a team can flourish by building a sense of competency, autonomy, and relatedness for everyone. When people feel that they are competent in what they are doing, that they have a choice of tasks and independence, and that somebody at work cares about them, they feel happier, grow better professionally, and feel more engaged with their jobs.</description></item><item><title>How to plan a company retreat</title><link>https://hygge.work/blog/workation-how-to/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/blog/workation-how-to/</guid><description>One of the most efficient ways to make people feel cozy and cared for is to arrange a great company retreat, or workation for them. It&amp;rsquo;s a sort of holiday event for a remote team where people get together in a beautiful place to hang out and work side by side.
We believe that workations are the best type of in-person gatherings for remote teams. They serve as a form of first aid for fully-distributed teams to heal all sorts of communication, intercultural, and work-related issues.</description></item><item><title>Inca Digital Benefits and Perks</title><link>https://hygge.work/blog/hygge-benefits/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hygge.work/blog/hygge-benefits/</guid><description>Inca Digital Benefits and Perks Well-thought benefits packages help Hygge companies retain their top-talents.
