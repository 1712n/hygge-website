One of the most efficient ways to make Hygge Companies' people feel cozy and cared, is to arrange a great [workation](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=workation) for them. We believe that workations serve as a first-aid for fully-distributed teams to heal all sorts of communication, intercultural, and work-related issues, therefore should be included into the basic [benefits](https://hygge.work/tags/benefits/) package. Bringing people to a colocated environment 2-4 times a year has a major impact on combating social isolation, preventing burn-out, and fostering new ties in the team that eventually can grow into new products for your business.

Looking through the bright pictures from a company retreat, you might feel that there's nothing easier than arranging a trip for your team. You just choose an appealing spot by the sea, book the flights, and here you are: enjoying the time together. However, when you have more than 10 people in a team, things get complicated. 

# Location
 Good news: appealing spot by the sea will do. Bad news: you have to consider entry requirements (e.g. visas), flights length and price, seasonal features, things to do, lodging options and others.

 ## Country  
 To make sure that everyone can enter the country you chose, you need to know the citizenship, residence permit and visa status of your team-members. The easiest option would be to choose a visa-free country for the majority of your team. Keep in mind, that the reality of obtaining a visa might be totally different from what's written in the documents, therefore it's always a good idea to check the live reviews on Reddit or other travelers online communities.

 ## Venue
One of the best options that works really well for small teams up to 30 people, is to book a cozy central venue using [AirBNB](https://en.airbnb.com/) or similar platfroms. This venue would serve as a hang-out spot for the whole team. 

Central venue quality criteria:
- **Space.** There should be a huge living room with a welcoming sofa, large dining table, and a number of tiny cozy angles where your lovely introverts would be able to snuggle with their lovely laptops. Instagrammable view and catchy design are the advantages. 
- **Area.** In our experience, you can encounter spacious venues either in downtown of big cities or in the middle of nowhere. Both options might work or not for your particular team. While megapolis give you a plenty of activities and eating-out options, deliveries and easy commuting, isolated houses in the wilds will provide a chance to spend time closer to each other and bring retreat vibes (together with rent-a-car/find-a-driver headache). Make sure there are other lodging options nearby for those who wouldn't get a bedroom in the central venue.
- **Internet.** Workation concept assumes that your team will spend some time working together while staying at the central venue. [Wireless travel repeater](https://www.amazon.com/GL-iNet-GL-MT1300-Wireless-Pocket-Sized-Repeater/dp/B08MKZXGBY/) will help to enhance the connection. 
- **Dishwasher.** Golden rule: wherever you are, your place should have a dishwasher. Just write it down. 

Coworking is a second preferred option. Opt for modern, comfy and relaxed options and try to avoid open-office spaces that kill the vibes. One spacious shared room for all of your team would be the best choice.
