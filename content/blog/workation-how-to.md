One of the most efficient ways to make Hygge Companies' people feel cozy and cared, is to arrange a great [workation](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=workation) for them. We believe that workations serve as a first-aid for fully-distributed teams to heal all sorts of communication, intercultural, and work-related issues, therefore should be included into the basic [benefits](https://hygge.work/tags/benefits/) package. Bringing people to a colocated environment 2-4 times a year has a major impact on combating social isolation, preventing burn-out, and fostering new ties in the team that eventually can grow into new products for your business.

Looking through the bright pictures from a company retreat, you might feel that there's nothing easier than arranging a trip for your team. You just choose an appealing spot by the sea, book the flights, and here you are: enjoying the time together. However, when you have more than 10 people in a team, things get complicated. 

# Flights and rides

When it comes to travelling, everyone has personal preferences. To manage the booking workload, consder onboarding a travel management provider, e.g. [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/), [FlightFox](https://flightfox.com/) or [Kayak Business](https://www.kayak.com/business). Before choosing the best fit for your team, check the rates, flexibility policies, concierge service and SSO options. Our vote goes for those that help with Airbnb and provide various travel options, including car rent and train tickets booking.  

# Location
Good news: appealing spot by the sea will do. Bad news: you have to consider entry requirements (e.g. visas), flights length and price, seasonal features, things to do, lodging options and others.

 ## Country  
 To make sure that everyone can enter the country you chose, you need to know the citizenship, residence permit and visa status of your team-members. The easiest option would be to choose a visa-free country for the majority of your team. Keep in mind, that the reality of obtaining a visa might be totally different from what's written in the documents, therefore it's always a good idea to check the live reviews on Reddit or other travelers online communities. Another best practice is to have a local host from your team-mates or to send on-the-foot soldier some 10-15 days in advance to explore the surroundings. 

 ## Venue
One of the best options that works really well for small teams up to 30 people, is to book a cozy central venue using [Airbnb](https://en.airbnb.com/) or similar platforms. This venue would serve as a hang-out spot for the whole team. 

Central venue quality criteria:
- **Space.** There should be a huge living room with a welcoming sofa, large dining table, and a number of tiny cozy angles where your lovely introverts would be able to snuggle with their lovely laptops. Instagrammable view and catchy design are the advantages. 
- **Area.** In our experience, you can encounter spacious venues either in downtown of big cities or in the middle of nowhere. Both options might work or not for your particular team. While megapolis give you a plenty of activities and eating-out options, deliveries and easy commuting, isolated houses in the wilds will provide a chance to spend time closer to each other and bring retreat vibes (together with rent-a-car/find-a-driver quests). Make sure there are other lodging options nearby for those who wouldn't get a bedroom in the central venue.
- **Bedrooms** Don't get carried away with big beautiful apartments. In our experience 3 bedrooms are perfect for a central venue. This way you'll have a spacious place with hosts without turning it into a dorm. 
- **Internet.** Workation concept assumes that your team will spend some time working together while staying at the central venue. [Wireless travel repeater](https://www.amazon.com/GL-iNet-GL-MT1300-Wireless-Pocket-Sized-Repeater/dp/B08MKZXGBY/) will help to enhance the connection. 
- **Dishwasher.** Golden rule: wherever you are, your place should have a dishwasher. Just write it down. 

Coworking is a second preferred option. Opt for modern, comfy and relaxed options and try to avoid open-office spaces that kill the vibes. One spacious shared room for all of your team would be the best choice.  

# Time  
Best timing for workation depends on your business. It wouldn't ever be possible to accommodate everyone's preferences, so aim for 60-70% participation rate from the very beginning. Check for the weather, local fests and big events at your location to avoid overbooked venues and give people the timeframes from the very beginning. Opt for planning at least 1.5-2 months in advance, so that your team has enough time to check their travel docs and book convenient flights on manageable price.

## Length and schedule
Best workations are long workations. If your team is in the stage of forming, 2 weeks together will give everyone some understanding of who is who. The most bonding workation case we had is a 1-month-long retreat in Mexico. Cozy big house created a family-like atmosphere, and relaxed schedule allowed everyone to build connections naturally and without any pressure.

However, long workations are not always feasible, so here is the list of empirical observations to consider:
- any workation that is up to 5 days long will turn into a marathon both for organizers and for a team. By the day 3-4 people would get exhausted and would stop showing up for any kind of activities.
- plan lots chillax working sessions where people can just be together without any need to interact.
- make all the activities optional.
- team-leads HAVE TO make a conscious attempt to use this time to get to know their teams, even if the gathering is 1-day-long.

## Activities
In Hygge companies, we always leave an opportunity for the team-members to come up with any activity initiative. There are no limits and just one rule: they should convince somebody from the team to come along. Someone is arranging winery tour, somebody goes for surfing classes, others prefer spending their evenings playing board games. 

In case the team is fresh and timid, organizers need to think of activities by themselves. Road trips to discover breathtaking views, cooking together and quite movie-watching nights could be a good start for any team.

## Memories
Another great way for bringing people together is make each workation special. There's nothing funnier than watching your colleagues playing paparazzi with instant cameras or stepping out to share a funny story that contributes to your offline workshop. Be creative - polaroid photos, interactive workshops, cooking tutorials. The world is your oyster! 

# Feedback
After the workation is over, talk to the team. Approach people individually asking about their "here and now" experience. Put together a survey. Bring up workation follow-up on a weekly call. Collect feedback of your [MVP](https://hygge.work/remote-work/planning/#mvp) workation and try to improve the following gathering relying on your data.
