Hygge Work is a multidisciplinary GitHub-based project with various contributors. It is a vibrant tapestry of individuals who hail from different backgrounds and experiences. Some of us are the innovators, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Others are the meticulous documentarians, capturing the essence of successful remote teamwork experiences.

Each member of our team brings a unique perspective and skill set to the table. We don't just talk the talk; we walk the walk. Every idea that flows from the pens (or keyboards) of our authors is rigorously tested in the real world within multiple remote teams across the globe.

Some contributors are mentioned below. Get to know the remarkable individuals who make up our team and explore the wealth of knowledge and practical wisdom they bring to the world of remote teamwork.
