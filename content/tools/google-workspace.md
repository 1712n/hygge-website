Google Workspace is the professional version of GMail, Calendar, Meet, Docs, Team Drive, and much more. Corporate Google account does not only give access to all that ecosystem, but also serves as the key to other web application. The world where you needed to create separate accounts with unique passwords for each application is fading away. It is being replaced with Google and other identity providers that handle your credentials and enforce company-wide policies on application access.

**Google Calendar** can be used to manage schedules, so people can easily plan and organize meetings, conference calls, and other events. You can subscribe to a Company Calendar to see everyone's birthdays and add other team members' calendars to always be up-to date on their work schedule. If you prefer fixed working hours, you can enable them in your Google Calendar. In case you are planning to be off work for a while, set your "Out of office" days. 

For all public email addresses and subscriptions, it's always a good idea to set up Google Groups with team-specific addresses (e.g. hiring@mycompany.com or finance.department@mycompany.com). They allow forwarding incoming mail to all group members. Don't forget to CC those addresses when replying to these emails or communicating externally on behalf of your team. Reach out to group owners or Google Workspace admins if you need to be added to a group.

For those rare occasions when GitHub isn't enough, there's **Google Meet** for video calls. You can find a link to join a Meet call in almost all Google Calendar event descriptions. Always use a headset with a microphone and remember to mute yourself when not talking. Don't forget to record any important decisions and do-outs in the corresponding GitHub issues after the call.

Keep in mind that all work meetings/calls should be optional, allowing team members who prefer asynchronous communication, to collaborate through GitHub instead. However, it's important to manage your isolation and mental health, so don't be shy to leverage video calls to get some face time to boost morale. Yes, people want to see your pet, say "Hi" to your partner and know a little more about that painting on your wall.

The regular team calls mostly serve team building purposes. Any meaningful decisions taken during those calls should be copied over to GitHub. Think about preparing a slide that references GitHub milestones and issues and making recordings for the team members who can't make it.

**Do:**
* Take the conversation to GitHub when possible.
* Always use "Reply all" option to be sure you do not exclude anyone from the conversation.
* Search for keywords in your Google Drive before asking others to help you locate something.
* Use Sign-in with Google feature when creating 3rd party website accounts to stay safe and to not having to remember another password.
* Leverage nonwork calls and be intentional about informal communication. It's worth spending time to build personal relationships and talk about personal stuff.

**Avoid:**
* Working in offline Word or Excel files and uploading/attaching them to Emails and GitHub issues later. Those are difficult to find and collaborate on.
* Working on documents privately and sharing them from your Google Drive space. Instead, place them into relevant [Google Team Drives](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/shared-drives). This will allow you to share your documents with appropriate team members and maintain control over the access. Use versioning feature of Google Drive to update documents without changing the sharing link and don't forget to double-check the recipients' access permissions.
* Not documenting one-on-one work calls. Document the main outtakes in GitHub afterwards or use GitHub comment section for communication.
* Creating or using new communication/documentation tools to accomplish tasks which can be completed with existing ones.
