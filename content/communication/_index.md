Whether it’s different time zones or having a fully distributed asynchronous team, practicing clear and effective communication is crucial. To accomplish this, Hygge companies communicate through issue trackers and corporate chats. On the rare occasions when this isn’t enough, jump on a synchronous video call. To find out when we use GitHub, chats, and calls, refer to the [Tools section](https://hygge.work/tools/).

**If it’s not in GitHub, it never happened.** Hygge Companies preserve all key conversations and discussions in the issue tracker so they have the entire history of their projects in one place. All arrangements made outside the issue tracker (calls, messengers, email, etc.) are duplicated in issues or wikis. It is also essential to reply promptly to all requests on GitHub. Generally, Hygge Culture frowns upon work-related one-on-one conversations and reserves them for administrative, personal, and team-building matters.

**Structure.** One way to show other team members that you value their time is to add more structure to your communication. Provide context, make lists, link issues, add labels, and use [milestones](https://hygge.work/github/milestones/). Without these, it will be hard for them to determine why you are doing something and whether it makes sense at all. Demonstrate that you did your research and organized your thoughts before involving other people in your [issues](https://hygge.work/github/issue-tracker/#issues).
