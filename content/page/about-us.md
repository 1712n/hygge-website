Hygge approach for managing fully remote teams was born in 2016. Weâ€™ve studied successful remote projects, brought in organizational evidence-based practices, and personally experimented with all the ideas well before COVID changed the work culture landscape. Hygge workbook serves as a handbook  in a number of distributed teams that are proud to call themselves Hygge Companies.

If you are serious about building smart internal processes in your team, Hygge team will guide you through all the necessary steps to create meaningful work culture.
