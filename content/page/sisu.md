Remote work can be challenging. High levels of stress, management challenges, lack of social interaction â€“ can all burn you out. You need to develop internal Sisu to keep you going!

## What is Sisu?

[Sisu](https://finland.fi/arts-culture/sisu-within-finnish-key-life-love-success/) is a unique Finnish concept. You could say that _sisu_ is energy, determination in the face of adversities that are more demanding than usual. It is the quality that lets pick up, move on, and learn something from previous failures.

We all have these moments when we all need to reach beyond what we think we are capable of. And then we have some kind of force that allows us to continue and succeed even when we thought we couldnâ€™t. For Finns, that â€˜second windâ€™ of inner strength is Sisu.

On this page, you can find some of the ideas that will keep you sane in a demanding remote environment, no matter what your life or work throws at you.

## Work-Life balance

It's important to manage your isolation and mental health. While remote work affords us greater flexibility, it also makes disconnecting challenging sometimes. It can be hard to set up boundaries if your office is in your bedroom or at the kitchen table.
* Understand your limitations and be realistic, expect imperfection. Don't compare yourself to others. Study your work style and accept it.
* Schedule breaks in your day to interact with friends or family in the home, or nearby in your community.
* Devote time for self: prioritize your interests (sports, music, reading, etc.) and stay healthy (eat right, exercise).
* Experiment with working in a shared setting (e.g. a local coworking venue) or try alternative places to work like coffee shops or local parks.
* Consider psychological counselling that is beneficial for almost everyone.

## Counseling
[Counseling](https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/counseling) is a way to help people with a broad variety of mental and emotional difficulties. For the most part, it involves talking about an emotional difficulty with a trained therapist. Psychotherapists build these conversations to help you with your challenge. You can work through any situation that lasts for a while and causes psychological discomfort in you. E.g., Mary often feels offended by her colleague's comments. John is procrastinating his job by scrolling Instagram for hours. Elizabeth feels incapable of completing issues after receiving negative feedback. All these things are among the many reasons to consult a professional.

Rule of the thumb: all in all, you should **feel better** after the session. Of all the factors in choosing a counselor, *finding one that you click with* is perhaps the most crucial. Hundreds of studies show that the relationship between psychologist and client is crucial for the success of counselling. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t get it right the first time round. Sometimes it's necessary to play the field a bit to find your perfect match ðŸ˜‰

There are a lot of misconceptions of psychotherapy. To get reliable information about who needs counseling, how to choose your psychotherapist and what is normal about this process, consult [this comprehensive article](https://www.apa.org/topics/psychotherapy/understanding) from APA.
