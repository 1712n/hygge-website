Project boards is a managing tool to improve visibility of the work progress. All GitHub projects are located on the organisational level. Use spreadsheets view for Team Projects and kanban view for Personal Projects.

**Tip:** It is good idea to add a project board in your browser’s [bookmark bar](https://workona.com/reviews/chrome-bookmark-toolbar/), that way you will have quick access.

**Personal Boards** are there to keep and organize your tasks. Each person is in charge of their own board with collaboration of team manager. You can adjust the layout - add your column for specific topics if needed, but don’t forget to prioritize - make sure to keep the clear distinction between high and low priority issues. You can discuss issues priority with your team lead/manager.

 Issues are added manually to the personal project board, make sure you always transfer your issues. Once you are assigned to an issue, [add it to your project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board).

**Tip:**   You can also add other issues, discussions, even project boards - anything you are interested in following directly from the project column. Simply copy and paste the links and add a new project card. Project cards support GitHub Markdown, feel free to create lists, hyperlinks, use bold/italics, etc.
 
**Team Boards** are used to prioritize work on milestones and products. Issues are added automatically based on Team label in the issue or the repo type. Team boards are supervised by team managers.

**Team managers are able:** 

- Set due dates
- Monitor the process
- Modify issues if needed (delete/change assignees, labels)
- See all the issues sorted by milestones, high and low priorities

**Tip:**  Add the link to Team board to your Personal Board for the quick access to your team priorities.
