Every newcomer's journey at Hygge Company starts with a personal project. Personal project is a private space to set and track personal milestones. It can take different forms - personal repository or a dashboard, depends on an issue tracker that Hygge company uses. 

Enjoy making daily to-do lists? Want to test how markdown on GitHub works? Planning to learn Python from a colleague? 
Personal project is a powerful tool that satisfies all those needs. It goes far beyond opening new issues. It's a place to create custom labels for prioritization and structuring, use milestones for bigger goals, and assign or ping other people who can help.

## Onboarding
Adaptation to new team culture, new tools, and new people can be overwhelming. To make the transition comfortable, Hygge companies put onboarding issues in personal projects of every newbie. That way newcomers can push new buttons without being afraid to break anything. All the essential information about the company is also in the onboarding issues. Hygge work approach, best practices, meeting the team ‚Äî it's all in the Welcome Kit. 

Below are a few issue and email templates of a personal project for a mid-size org. Feel free to add/remove tasks based on the size of your team and your needs.
