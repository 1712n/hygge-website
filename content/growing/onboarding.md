The first few months are crucial to the success of the new hire. The newcomer will either buy in by investing their time and attention or treat the company as a paycheck printer, working hard enough not to get fired.

[Buddies](https://hygge.work/growing/buddy-guidelines/) help to make onboarding experience engaging, yet well-organized and structured. Work-related information, served in tiny bits in the issue-tracker, facilitates the smooth transition to work culture of a Hygge company.

## Teams

The following teams are usually involved in the onboarding process:

- **IAM Team** will be creating accounts and making sure the newcomer has access to all needed resources.
- **Hygge Team**'s job is to introduce the newcomer to the teamâ€™s culture and to make sure the shift is smooth.
- **Organization Ops Team** is tasked with administrative duties like writing contracts, running payroll, and resolving any personal issues. It usually consists of selected members of other teams - legal, accounting, executive, etc.

## Templates

The onboarding process starts after the contract is signed. An onboarding issue is created to ping all relevant teams and trigger required processes to get the new team member settled in. Below are a few issue and email templates for a mid-size org, feel free to add/remove tasks based on the size of your team and your needs.

## First Milestone review

The onboarding process doesn't stop when the newcomer is set up. As they start working and learning more about the team, products, and organization as a whole, their skills might turn out to be useful somewhere else in the company. This is why it is important for the onboarding buddy to find a balance between letting newcomers wander around to see the bigger picture and laser focusing them on completing the initial milestone. At the end of the milestone, Hygge Team sends a milestone/3-month [survey form](https://forms.gle/yY1QoP2yahNKoVZz6) to the newcomer's key colleagues to get feedback and share it with the Hiring Manager. This feedback serves as a breeding ground to build a roadmap of personal and professional development.
