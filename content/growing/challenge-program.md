Challenge program is a perfect tool to discover hidden talent through autonomously vetting potential employees and interns at the start of the hiring process. They consist of issues that can be solved without any access to company resources and require the participants to manage their own work. These projects give interested individuals a chance to prove themselves, learn a bit about our company & products, and produce a useful result in the process. In addition to that, it allows companies to suggest a better fit for candidates, based on their challenge results.

Here's an [example of a challenge program](https://github.com/inca-digital/challenge/issues) developed by Inca Digital.

### Bounty Issues

Bounty issues are the main building blocks of a challenge program and should:

* be targeting driven people in a way that demonstrates their ability, creativity, and work mentality (this is crucial to identify talented issue solvers early).
* be explicit and clear tasks with defined metrics of successful completion (but with the ability to go above and beyond if possible).
* produce useful results for us, and reduce our workload in some capacity.
* not take much of any time from our team (to be accomplished, or to vet/use the finished results.)
* not have required internal understanding of our internal systems or special access/permissions to complete.

### Issues Structure

Each issue requires the following parts:

* **Description** - explains what the task is and how it might be used/integrated.
* **Requirements/Functionality** - details the specifications of the task, how results should be formatted/represented, which aspects to prioritize, qualitative or quantitative definitions of completion. 
* **Specific Necessary Resources** - tools, libraries, or files that will be needed to complete the issue.
